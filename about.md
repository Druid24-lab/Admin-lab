title: 👨‍💻 About me 
---

I still remember the joy it gave me as a kid resetting my first BIOS password.
I have always been fascinated about Technology and always wondered how it can improve lives.
I have a Bachelors in Business Information Technology and experience working as a web developer.  

In the next chapter of my life I would like to pivot into
Healthcare IT because I'd like to help people and improve lives.
I find solving problems for other users very rewarding, I enjoy long walks, good music and engaging conversations.
Currently, I live in Germany and mostly preoccupied with work and learning german.
I am always open for freelance gigs so feel free to hit me up😉.
