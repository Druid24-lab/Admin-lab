title: 👨‍💻 About me 
---

I still remember the joy it gave me as a kid resetting my first BIOS password.
I have always been fascinated about Technology and how it can improve lives.
I have a Bachelors in Business Information Technology and experience working as a web developer.  

In the next chapter of my life I hope to seek a Sys Admin role.
I find problem solving very rewarding, I enjoy long walks, good music and engaging conversations.
Currently, I live in Germany and mostly preoccupied with work and learning german.
Feel free to hit me up for offers & gigs.🕵🏿‍♀️
