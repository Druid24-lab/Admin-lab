title: 👨‍💻 About me 
---


With a Bachelor's in Business Information Technology and experience
working as a PHP Web developer, I later discovered an interest and 
passion for hands-on work with systems, networks, supporting users and Health IT. 

Since then, I am focused on pivoting into an IT support or system administration role, 
where I can combine technical expertise with a passion for keeping IT systems running 
smoothly.  
  
Outside of work, I enjoy learning 🇩🇪German, 🛠️tinkering with cars and 
reading about latest news in Tech & Science.
