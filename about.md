title: 👨‍💻 About me 
---

I still remember the joy it gave me as a kid resetting my first BIOS password.
I have always been fascinated about Technology and how it can improve lives.
I have a Bachelors in Business Information Technology and experience working as a web developer.  

I enjoy problem solving, long walks, good music and engaging conversations.
Currently, I live in Germany and mostly preoccupied with work and learning german.
Feel free to hit me up for offers & freelance gigs.🕵🏿‍♀️
