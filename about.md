title: 👨‍💻 About me 
---

I still remember the joy it gave me as a kid the first time I reset Bios password
because I had just learnt about CMOS. Years later I got a degree in Business IT 
and worked a year as a web developer. It was an exciting journey and I have learnt soo much 
like Business Operations, IT Managment, Programming... simply put how IT can enhance Businesses. 

In the next chapter of my life I would like to pivot into
Healthcare IT. I wanna wake up everyday knowing I had the tiniest impact.
I find solving problems for other users very rewarding. I enjoy long walks, good music and engaging conversations.
Currently, I live in Germany and mostly preoccupied with work and learning german.
I am getting IT certifications related to healthcare and open to job offers in the 
Healthcare industry. [resume](https://lebenslauf-addo-isaiah.tiiny.site)
