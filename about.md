title: 💻 About me 
---


With a Bachelor's in Business Information Technology and experience
working as a PHP Web developer, I discovered my true passion lies in
hands-on work with systems, networks and supporting users.  

Since then, I have focused on building practical IT skills through personal 
projects. My goal is to grow into a full-time IT support or system administration role, 
where I can combine technical expertise with a passion for keeping IT systems running smoothly.  
  
Outside of work, I enjoy learning 🇩🇪German, 🛠️tinkering with cars and reading about latest news in Tech & Science.
